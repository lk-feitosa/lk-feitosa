Hi there! 👋 I'm a curious and driven tech enthusiast with a background in **Systems Analysis and Development (ADS)**.  
Currently diving deeper into **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **front-end development**.  

I’m passionate about learning, building, and exploring how things work — whether it’s through web interfaces or behind the scenes with scripts and servers.  

Outside of code, I’m a cat lover 🐱, gaming fan 🎮, and a tech explorer always tinkering with new setups.  
Lately, I’ve been working on building my own **home server** — learning about self-hosting and Linux-based environments as a **home server enthusiast**.

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
